# RentHub: A Peer-to-Peer Rental Marketplace
RentHub is an online rental marketplace that connects people who have items to rent with those who need them temporarily. Instead of buying expensive equipment, tools, vehicles, or fashion items for short-term use, users can rent them from owners at an affordable price. The platform ensures a smooth, secure, and user-friendly experience for both owners (who list items for rent) and customers (who rent items).

## How It Works

- Owners can list items for rent by adding details such as pricing, availability, images, and descriptions on the Order Posting Page.

- Customers can browse available items using search filters like category, location, and price range.

- Each rental item has a dedicated Item Details Page, showing rental terms, user reviews, and an availability calendar.

- Customers can click "Book Now", review the Rental Agreement & Policies, and proceed with the Order Booking process.

- Owners get notifications for new rental requests and can choose to approve or reject them.
Once approved, both parties can communicate via the Chat & Messaging Page to finalize pickup/delivery details.

- Users can track rental history and due dates on the Account Details Page.

- The platform also features ratings and reviews, allowing renters to share their experience, ensuring trust and reliability.
