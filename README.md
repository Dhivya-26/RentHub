# RentHub
## Project Overview:
  
  The Rental E-Commerce Platform is a web-based marketplace where individuals and businesses can rent and lease items such as cameras, tools, dresses, cars, and more. Users can list their items, set rental pricing and availability, and manage bookings through a calendar system. The platform facilitates direct owner-renter interactions, where payments are handled via cash on delivery (COD) instead of online transactions.
## Objective:
The project aims to provide a convenient and secure rental platform where:
 - Owners can list their items for rent with details, pricing, and availability.
 - Renters can browse available items, book them, and arrange pickup/delivery.
 - A built-in calendar system manages rental duration and availability.
 - Booking requests connect renters with item owners directly.
 - User authentication & verification prevent fraud and unauthorized transactions.
